## Inspiration
Despite learning Python in college and doing my fair share of programming projects, I never made a game before! Since I knew that one day of 'coding' would involve mostly *learning* how to make a game, most of this project involved commenting out and studying [existing code](https://github.com/popadi/python-flappy-bird). While I was at it, I also added my own fun touches.

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.7.x if necessary (instuctions [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python))

    `$ python --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. Install PyGame

    `$ python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`

## Usage
#### To run the game:
    $ python FlappyYogi.py

#### To play the game:
1. Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to start the game and to move the dog up or down.
2. The objective is to keep the dog 'flying' and squeeze between the obstacles. Once the dog collides with an obstacle, he will fall, signaling the end of a game. Press any <kbd>key</kbd> to start a new round.
3. The game can be exited at any time by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
