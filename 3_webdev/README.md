# Netflix Matrimony - 'Tinder' for Netflix üçø
#### 5 Python Projects in 5 Days - Day 3: Web Development

A Flask app that generates random movie recommendations, with details listed for each title, that a user can swipe through and watch with the click of a button.

## Inspiration
Since I now have a lot more free time on my hands, I‚Äôve been perusing Netflix more than usual. Despite their vast library, I can never find something to watch, and I don't think I'm alone. So, I wanted to make something that generates *completely* random recommendations, but still gives the user *some* information about the title before they watch. So, if someone is stuck in a movie rut, this app can help them branch out and try something new! üéû

## Installation
1. Install Flask

    ```$ pip install flask```
2. (Option) Install virtualenv to manage dependencies (only needed for Python 2 uesrs):

    ```$ pip install virtualenv # only needed for Python 2```

3. Obtain an API Key for OMDB, and add to a `config.py` file using the following format:

    ```
    api_key = "YOUR_KEY"
    ```
    If you are ever adding your own code to GitHub, make sure this `config.py` file is listed under a `.gitignore` file so it doesn't accidently get published to GitHub!

4. Download the CSV linked in [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) and name the file `catalog.csv`. This will store the bulk of our data.


## Usage
#### To launch the app:
    $ python main.py

Once the Flask app is running, navigate to the `localhost` link provided:

<code> * Running on <b>http://127.0.0.1:5000/</b> (Press CTRL+C to quit)</code>
